# SignaCraft - Elevating Sign Language Video Synthesis via Dynamic GAN Framework

## Overview

Welcome to SignaCraft, a cutting-edge project aimed at revolutionizing the synthesis of sign language videos through the application of a dynamic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. This project focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art in sign language video generation, leveraging innovative techniques for enhanced realism and authenticity.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic GAN Architecture:** Employing a dynamic GAN framework to push the boundaries of sign language video synthesis.
- **Diverse Datasets:** Trained and tested on diverse datasets, including RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T, ISL-CSLTR, and UCF101 Action Recognition, ensuring adaptability across different sign language contexts.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics:** Performance assessment includes Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Inception Score (IS), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID).
- **High Synthesis Success Rate:** Achieves a synthesis success rate of approximately 90%, capturing nuanced details for realistic sign language gestures.
